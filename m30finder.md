# Management 3.0 Practices Finder

This Management 3.0 Practices Finder (M30 Finder) seeks to make it as easy as possible for facilitators and others to quickly find a Management 3.0 Practice to address a particular need. 

The format of the M30 Finder is based on a taxonomy that groups the practices into six categories, where:
- The categories are loosely based on an original set of four categories, which are described at the bottom of the [Practices page on the Management 3.0 website](https://management30.com/practice/).
- In each cell in the table (which contains a set of Practices that fall under that category), you can find:
  - The name of the Practice, which links to its full description on the Management 3.0 website website
  - A short description of the practice 
  - Separate download link / link to additional information (as appicable)
